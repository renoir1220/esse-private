# Esse repository instructions

When a user asks Codex to install Esse from this private downstream repository or provides this repository URL with an installation request:

1. Read `INSTALL.md` completely before running commands.
2. For the Codex Plugin, use the repository installer and the requested GitHub Release. For the Agent Sidecar, use its published platform installer. Do not build from source unless the release path is unavailable and the user explicitly agrees to a developer installation.
3. Detect the user's operating system and architecture. The Codex Plugin supports Windows x64, macOS arm64, and macOS x64. New downstream Agent Sidecar releases support macOS arm64 only; Windows installers are historical and Intel Macs are unsupported.
4. Download scripts or artifacts to a temporary directory, verify the release SHA256 recorded in `latest.json` for the Plugin or `sidecar-latest.json` for the Agent Sidecar, and install only into the documented user-scoped Esse directory.
5. On macOS, let `install.sh` select the Gatekeeper-approved desktop app and its managed Node runtime. Never run a bare `codex` or `node` from `PATH`, remove quarantine attributes, or tell the user to bypass Gatekeeper.
6. Treat the installer's `ESSE_INSTALL_RESULT` as the registration result. Do not repeat its plugin-list commands through another Codex CLI; inspect the receipt and marketplace catalog statically if an additional check is needed.
7. Never ask the user to paste an API key into chat, a shell command, an environment variable, or a repository file.
8. After a successful private Sidecar install, tell the user to restart the Agent, start a new task, and say `打开 Esse 设置`. Provider credentials and the default image model must be configured inside the Esse settings UI. The separately released public Codex Plugin remains branded `Esse Community`.

For development work, preserve user-generated `inputs/`, `outputs/`, internal QA screenshots, and local credentials. They are not release artifacts and must not be committed.

Gallery grids, batch-browser cards, reference lists, and other repeated image surfaces must use bounded cached previews rather than decoding original files as thumbnails. Keep preview loading viewport-scoped, unload far-off decoded images, preserve the original aspect ratio with UI-provided letterboxing, and reserve original-file URLs for explicit full-image, download, copy, export, or Provider-reference operations. Any change to this path must pass the high-resolution thumbnail stress E2E before release.

## Repository architecture

- `plugins/codex` contains the Codex Plugin.
- `sidecars/agent` contains the Agent Sidecar for WorkBuddy and other local HTTP MCP Agents.
- `apps/standalone` is only a placeholder for a future true standalone application.
- Do not merge the old private `esse-desktop` Git history, server, billing, account, balance, channel-management, data, credentials, inputs, outputs, or QA artifacts into this repository.
- Do not introduce a shared Core or a runtime dependency between the Plugin and Agent Sidecar yet. Port behavior semantically and record meaningful parity changes in `SYNC.md`.
- Community releases use one tag and one GitHub Release with grouped Plugin and Agent Sidecar assets. A private downstream may publish only its Agent Sidecar on an independent version line when `sidecars/agent/product.json` declares `releaseVersionPolicy: "independent-sidecar"`; it continues to inherit the separately released Community Plugin. Do not create permanent product branches.

## Community-first downstream workflow

The public `renoir1220/esse` repository is the source of truth for shared, MIT-licensed Esse behavior. This checkout contains `PRIVATE-DOWNSTREAM.md` and is a private downstream, not an independent implementation of shared features.

1. Classify a requested change before editing. Task scheduling, MCP contracts, Provider adapters, reference handling, shared UI behavior, security fixes, and cross-edition tests are Community changes.
2. Implement and validate Community changes in `renoir1220/esse` first, publish them through a Community pull request, and merge that PR before updating a private downstream. Do not patch the downstream first or maintain a duplicate downstream-only commit for shared behavior.
3. After the Community PR merges, update the downstream by fetching and merging `upstream/main`. Resolve conflicts only in documented private overlays; do not manually copy or cherry-pick the shared implementation unless an exceptional merge blocker is documented in the PR.
4. Direct downstream changes are limited to private onboarding, managed connections, product configuration, private release automation, and paid-service code described by `PRIVATE-DOWNSTREAM.md`.
5. If the Community checkout, `upstream` remote, permission, or configuration is missing, repair or request that environment instead of bypassing the Community-first path.

## Product naming

The public MIT edition is called **Esse Community**. A private downstream may set `sidecars/agent/product.json` to the display name **Esse**. Do not use `Esse.Community`; the dot reads like a code namespace or domain rather than a product edition.

1. Edition-identifying surfaces must use the configured full display name: Electron window titles, installed application names, installer metadata, MCP and plugin titles, first mentions in user documentation, and settings-opening prompts.
2. After the edition is already clear, ordinary action phrases may use the shorter product name, such as `用 Esse 生成图片`. Never require packaging-specific phrases such as `用 Esse Sidecar 生成图片` or `用 Esse Desktop 生成图片`.
3. Technical identifiers remain stable for compatibility, including the plugin name `esse`, MCP configuration key `esse`, bundle IDs, executable names, and existing application-data directories. Do not rename these merely to mirror the display name.
4. Terms such as `Codex Plugin`, `Agent Sidecar`, and `Standalone App` may be used only where developers or installers need to distinguish distribution forms. They are not separate user-facing brands.
5. Assume a customer installs one edition and one appropriate distribution form. Do not ask the user to choose between edition labels during normal operation.

## GitHub release validation

Every time a new Esse version is published on GitHub, verify installation on an authorized Apple Silicon Mac through the user-facing flow documented in `INSTALL.md`. The maintainer's Windows workstation cannot accept a new Mac-only release:

1. Use the repository installer and the newly published GitHub Release; do not substitute a source build or developer cache install.
2. Inspect the installer from a fresh temporary checkout before running it.
3. Require a successful `ESSE_INSTALL_RESULT` and verify that the installed receipt version matches the new release.
4. Treat this installation as part of the release smoke test. A release is not fully handed off until the user-path installation succeeds or the exact blocker is reported.
5. New downstream releases build only macOS ARM64 on GitHub-hosted runners; do not build locally or restore self-hosted routing. Publisher signing is optional until the maintainer restores credentials. A platform must either receive its complete signing/notarization secret set or no signing secrets at all; partial configuration is a release error. Unsigned Windows artifacts must be verified as unsigned. macOS app bundles without Developer ID credentials must be fully ad-hoc signed after packaging and pass strict structural signature verification. Disclose accurately that neither mode establishes publisher identity or Apple notarization.

## GitHub release notes

Write every GitHub Release note as a version-specific, bilingual changelog:

1. Put Simplified Chinese first and English second. Keep both sections semantically aligned.
2. Lead directly with the changes in this version. Do not include a general product introduction, platform overview, or routine installation instructions; those belong in `README.md`, `README.en.md`, and `INSTALL.md`.
3. Emphasize user-visible additions, improvements, and fixes. State the practical impact instead of merely listing changed files or internal implementation details.
4. Derive the content from the previous-tag comparison and merged pull requests. Do not claim changes that cannot be verified from the release diff.
5. Omit release-preparation noise such as version bumps, packaging-only commits, and duplicated auto-generated changelogs unless they materially affect users.
6. End each language section with the matching full-changelog comparison link. Include pull request links only when they add useful detail.
