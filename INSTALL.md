# Install Esse

This file is the installation contract for an Agent given only this repository URL. This private repository publishes the Agent Sidecar as **Esse**. The separately released public Codex Plugin is **Esse Community**.

## Required outcome

For Codex/ChatGPT, install the Plugin from the public Esse Community GitHub Release into the current user's profile, register the `esse-local` marketplace, install and enable `esse`, verify the result, then guide the user through restart and UI-only default model setup. For WorkBuddy or another local HTTP MCP Agent, install the private Agent Sidecar from this repository's Release.

Do not ask the user to download an archive manually. Do not ask for a Provider API key in chat. Never disable or bypass Gatekeeper.

## Agent procedure

1. Confirm the host is Windows x64, macOS arm64, or macOS x64. Stop with a clear unsupported-platform message otherwise.
2. Read the installer before executing it. The installer may request network access to `github.com` and write access only to the user's Esse application-data directory and Codex plugin configuration.
3. Run the repository installer. It downloads `latest.json` and the matching versioned archive from the latest GitHub Release, verifies SHA256, and performs an idempotent user-scoped installation.
4. Treat an `ESSE_INSTALL_RESULT` line with `status: "installed"` as the structured success marker. The installer performs plugin registration and verification with its selected Codex executable; do not repeat those commands through a bare `codex` from `PATH`.
5. Do not try to open Esse in the same task. Newly installed skills and MCP tools load after the desktop app restarts and a new task begins.

This procedure installs the Codex Plugin. For WorkBuddy or another Agent that consumes a local HTTP MCP, use the Agent Sidecar procedure below instead; do not install both merely to offer a choice.

### Windows

Prefer a shallow temporary clone so the script can be inspected before execution:

```powershell
$target = Join-Path ([IO.Path]::GetTempPath()) ("esse-install-" + [guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N"))
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/renoir1220/esse.git $target
Get-Content -Raw -Encoding UTF8 (Join-Path $target "install.ps1")
& (Join-Path $target "install.ps1")
```

If `git` is unavailable, download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renoir1220/esse/main/install.ps1` to a temporary file, inspect it, and run that file with PowerShell.

### macOS

Prefer a shallow temporary clone so the script can be inspected before execution:

```bash
target="$(mktemp -d)/esse"
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/renoir1220/esse.git "$target"
sed -n '1,320p' "$target/install.sh"
bash "$target/install.sh"
```

If `git` is unavailable, download `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renoir1220/esse/main/install.sh` to a temporary file, inspect it, and run it with `bash`. Do not pipe a remote script directly into a shell.

The macOS package does not contain an Esse-built Mach-O executable. Its small Bash launcher runs the JS MCP with the signed Node.js runtime managed by Codex/ChatGPT, so the user does not need to install Node or obtain an Apple Developer certificate. Before changing plugin registration, the installer:

- rejects legacy macOS packages that contain the old standalone Esse executable;
- verifies and self-tests the managed Node.js runtime;
- selects only a Gatekeeper-approved Codex/ChatGPT desktop app;
- refuses to fall back to an arbitrary `codex` command from `PATH`.

If one of these checks fails, stop and report the installer message. Do not run `xattr -d`, use `spctl --master-disable`, or instruct the user to choose an “Open Anyway” override. Updating and reopening the official desktop app is the supported recovery path.

## Required handoff

After verification, report the installed version and say:

1. Completely restart the Codex/ChatGPT desktop app.
2. Start a new task.
3. Say `打开 Esse Community 设置` or type `@esse` and ask it to open settings.
4. In the Esse Community UI, choose `Codex 生成` as the default model, or add a Provider, paste the API Key there, test the connection, choose one of its image models, and save.

Explicitly remind the user that the API Key belongs only in the Esse Community settings UI and should never be pasted into chat.

## Agent Sidecar procedure

Download these two assets from the same requested GitHub Release:

- `sidecar-latest.json`
- the platform and architecture asset named by that metadata file:
  - Windows x64: `windowsX64Asset`
  - macOS arm64: `macosArm64Asset`
  - macOS x64: `macosX64Asset`

Verify the asset SHA256 against the matching `*Sha256` field before opening it. The installed application and window are named Esse.

### Windows x64

Run the checksum-verified `.exe` installer. The release notes disclose whether the application and installer are Authenticode-signed. When the release is unsigned, report that Windows may show an unknown-publisher or SmartScreen warning and do not claim publisher verification. If Windows blocks the installer, stop and report the exact error; never disable Windows security controls.

### macOS arm64 and x64

Open the checksum-verified `.dmg`, drag `Esse.app` into Applications, and open Esse normally. The release notes disclose whether the app is Developer ID-signed, notarized by Apple, and contains a stapled ticket. An unsigned release may be rejected by Gatekeeper; if that happens, stop and report the exact error. Never remove quarantine attributes, disable Gatekeeper, or instruct the user to choose an override.

After installation, the user opens Esse and completes setup inside its settings page:

1. Paste the Esse Key into the first-run guide and wait for the connection test to pass.
2. Save a default image model. Advanced users may add a compatible Provider under Advanced settings.
3. Copy the Agent setup prompt from Esse, paste it into the Agent, and send it so the Agent can preserve existing MCP entries and add Esse.
4. Start a new Agent task and say `用 Esse 生成图片`.

Never request the API Key in chat or put it in an Agent configuration file. The MCP configuration contains only a local loopback endpoint and per-install pairing token. Once Esse accepts Provider work in the background, the Agent should return control immediately and should not poll or copy output back unless the user explicitly asks.

## Update behavior

Running the same installation request again installs the latest release. Versions are stored separately under the user-scoped Esse plugin directory, and the fixed local marketplace is switched only after the new runtime passes its self-test. If plugin registration fails, the installer restores the previous marketplace selection. macOS runtime or desktop-app trust failures happen before the marketplace is changed.
