# Plugin and Agent Sidecar parity

Esse currently has two independent implementations. They intentionally do not share a runtime Core yet. When behavior is ported between `plugins/codex` and `sidecars/agent`, record the user-visible contract here instead of adding a cross-package dependency.

## 2026-07-21 — initial Sidecar import

The Agent Sidecar snapshot preserves the following Plugin behavior semantically:

- durable batches with independently queued jobs and background Provider execution;
- local managed connection and advanced Provider profiles, per-offering model and price metadata, configurable concurrency, and OS-protected API keys;
- original-file persistence, history versions, selection, modification, deletion, previews, zoom, and overlay dismissal;
- real reference-image transfer by absolute path or registered Esse image ID;
- MCP submission that returns after durable acceptance, without routine polling, price narration, or automatic result retrieval;
- unknown-charge outcomes are not automatically retried;
- Provider-returned remote image URLs use China-first trusted DNS resolution, private-network rejection, redirect revalidation, and pinned public-address downloads;
- one user-facing product name: Esse.

The initial import deliberately excludes the private service, user accounts, balances, channel administration, hosted billing, and all credentials. It also leaves the Plugin and Sidecar stores isolated.

## 2026-07-21 — Agent handoff hardening

- Esse is described consistently as a Provider-neutral local image task workspace and execution harness, not as an image model or model architecture. Agents must not infer capabilities such as text or number rendering from Esse itself.
- A sufficiently specified request that names Esse is submitted without a generic model-capability warning or second confirmation.
- The same contract is delivered through MCP initialization instructions, the optional MCP prompt, and the model-visible descriptions of every Provider submission tool.
- Provider-backed acceptance now returns only the background execution flag, the short user reply, and an explicit stop directive. It omits batch IDs, job IDs, status, and other details that could invite unsolicited monitoring. Agent-owned generation still returns the exact IDs required for callbacks.
- Status and render tools explicitly treat a completed handoff as insufficient authorization to poll; only a later explicit user request permits status lookup or output retrieval.

## 2026-07-21 — Windows Sidecar window chrome

- The Windows Agent Sidecar uses a light integrated draggable title bar with native window controls and removes Electron's default `File / Edit / View / Window` menu. The image workspace no longer opens inside a visually separate black frame.
- Non-Windows builds retain their native window chrome and menu behavior.

## 2026-07-21 — Agent Sidecar batch output access

- Opening a batch output folder now creates and opens one managed per-batch folder containing the batch's current images and preserved versions, matching the Plugin's batch-scoped output-folder contract.
- The Sidecar uses filesystem links where supported, keeps the original image-store paths stable, and removes its managed batch links when an image is moved to Esse's trash.
- The Sidecar home navigation now uses the Esse application icon, and the Electron window no longer imposes a minimum width.

## 2026-07-21 — macOS Agent Sidecar parity

- Windows x64 and macOS arm64/x64 now package the same Sidecar source and runtime core; only paths, native window behavior, signing/notarization, and installer artifacts vary by platform.
- macOS keeps the native title bar and application menu, stays active after the last window closes, uses Keychain-backed Electron safe storage, and stores data under `~/Library/Application Support/esse-agent-sidecar`.
- The macOS release pipeline builds architecture-specific DMGs, checks bundle IDs, Mach-O architecture, bundled Esse icon resources, and packaged-app startup, and requires Developer ID signing plus Apple notarization for a published Release.
- The Windows Squirrel application ID no longer owns `%LOCALAPPDATA%\esse`, preventing the installer from deleting Codex Plugin history. The installer root, Plugin data, and Sidecar data now have three distinct identities.
- Windows executable, installer, runtime title bar, macOS app bundle, and DMG all use the Esse application icon rather than Electron defaults.

## 2026-07-22 — managed connection onboarding

- The Agent Sidecar ordinary setup path accepts one Esse Key, tests it before secure storage, and keeps managed connection details out of the renderer and MCP offering summaries.
- First-run onboarding guides a new user from Key validation to a paste-and-send Agent setup prompt; it can be dismissed without exposing Advanced settings.
- Custom Provider URLs, adapters, models, and concurrency remain available under Advanced settings. Existing managed preset credentials and batch history are recognized without deleting or rewriting user data.
- Gallery thumbnails keep their wide-layout width as the window narrows; responsive layout now reduces the column count instead of enlarging cards.
- The Codex Plugin has not yet adopted this new onboarding hierarchy; port it semantically before claiming setup-flow parity.

## 2026-07-22 — language, retry, and managed execution controls

- Agent-facing Sidecar and Codex skills now require image prompts to follow the user's current language, defaulting to Simplified Chinese when the language is unclear.
- Batches with failures expose one title-level action that retries every retryable failed job together; clicking it is the explicit approval for any included unknown-charge retry.
- Ordinary Esse settings expose managed concurrency alongside the default model. New and legacy-default managed connections use 10 concurrent tasks unless the user changes it.
- Model selectors no longer display currency amounts. Stored price metadata remains available internally until the product moves to points.

## 2026-07-22 — edition boundary

- The public desktop product is now identified as Esse Community and keeps the original Provider-first settings with no first-run onboarding.
- Commercial onboarding and managed-service behavior live in a separate private downstream repository whose release line starts at `1.0.0`.
- `sidecars/agent/product.json` is the small edition overlay for names, bundle IDs, data directories, installer names, and release asset prefixes; build verification reads this profile on Windows and macOS.
- Shared gallery, retry, prompt-language, Agent handoff, MCP, and image-history fixes remain in the public upstream and are merged downstream.

## 2026-07-23 — per-job Agent reference isolation

- Agent-owned batches expose only callback-safe batch/job summaries until `start_agent_image_job` is called for one exact job.
- Each start call returns only that job's Prompt and reference paths. Concurrent jobs remain separate outbound image-generation requests; reference paths and request-size checks must never be aggregated across the batch.

## Deferred

- shared domain/provider/UI packages;
- physical-device macOS UI validation beyond GitHub-hosted arm64/x64 packaging and smoke checks;
- a true standalone application under `apps/standalone`.
